        Australia's migration and its demographics has been a crucial topic for those that reside in Australia. 
        It is a considerable factor that influences Australia's population, economy, social, and many other important aspects of the country.
        Therefore, the following visualisations has been made to provide deeper understanding on migrations to Australia.

          Australia's Net Migration
        </h1>

        </h4>
        <p>
          The waterfall chart on the right shows the changes in net migration to Australia from 2000 to 2024.
          The term net migration here refers to total increase or decrease of population through immigration and emigration of Australians and non-Australians, including short-term and long-term. <br>
          <br>
          The number of migrants moving in was significantly increasing from 2004 and peaked at 2008 before it began to fluctuate from 2009 to 2017.
          In 2018, the net migration decreased and dramatically dropped in 2020 before it rose up again to a steady figure from 2021 onwards.

          Net Long-term Migration for Each State
        </h1>
        <p>
          The choropleth map illustrates the proportions of the long-term net migration of each Australian state with respect to the sum of counts of people moving in and out every month.
          Here, the term long-term net migration refers to Australian Bureau of Statistics' definition of net migration, which counts international migrants that stays or is away from Australia for at least 12 months in a 16-month period. <br>
          <br>
          The long-term net migration proportions remained steady until a period between 2019 and 2020, where it reached a negative figure for most states due to COVID-19 lockdowns.
          After that, the states' long-term net migration proportions started to recover to its usual amount.

        According to the population pyramid below, most of those groups increrased in numbers and peaked in the year period 2022-2023. <br>
        Afterwards, their figures moderately decreased in the period 2023-2024.

          For all year periods, most of the male overseas migrants were aged between 20 and 29. But as the age group gets older, there are less migrants moving in.

        <p>
          The area chart to the right suggests that long-term migrants increased in number and peaked in the 2022-2023 period for all types of visa groups. The figure then decreased steadily in the 2023-2024 period. <br>
          <br>
          Out of all migrants, most of them appeared to hold temporary visas.
