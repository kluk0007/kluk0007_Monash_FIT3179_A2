        Australia's migration and its demographics has been a crucial topic for those that reside in Australia. 
        It is a considerable factor that influences Australia's population, economy, social, and many other important aspects of the country.
        Therefore, the following visualisations has been made to provide deeper understanding on migrations to Australia.

          Australia's Net Migration

        </h4>
        <p>
          The waterfall chart on the right illustrates the changes in net migration to Australia from 2000 to 2024.
          Net migration refers to the total increase or decrease in the population resulting from immigration and emigration of both Australians and non-Australians, including short-term and long-term movements. <br>
          <br>
          From 2004, the number of migrants moving into Australia <span style="color: #4287f5; font-weight: bold;">grew</span> significantly and peaked in 2008.
          Between 2009 and 2017, migration numbers fluctuated before declining in 2018.
          A sharp <span style="color: #f5424b; font-weight: bold;">drop</span> occurred in 2020, followed by a steady recovery from 2021 onwards.

          Net Long-term Migration for Each State
        </h1>
        <p>
          The choropleth map on the left shows the proportion of long-term net migration for each Australian state relative to the total number of people moving in and out each month.
          Long-term net migration follows the Australian Bureau of Statistics' definition, counting international migrants who stay in or are away from Australia for at least 12 months within a 16-month period. <br>
          <br>
          Since 2014, these proportions remained relatively stable until 2019-2020, when most states experienced a <span style="color: #f5424b; font-weight: bold;">decline</span> to negative values due to COVID-19 lockdowns.
          Afterwards, their long-term net migration proportions have gradually <span style="color: #4287f5; font-weight: bold;">recovered</span> to their usual levels.

          Top 5 Countries for Net Long-term Migration

        <p>
          The bar chart on the right conveys the net long-term migration from the top 5 countries.<br>
          <br>
          For most periods, China and India had the highest net migration to Australia, while Australia itself consistently had negative net migration.<br>
          <br>
          However, between December 2019 and March 2022, net migration from China and India <span style="color: #f5424b; font-weight: bold;">fell</span> sharply into negative values, while Australia briefly experienced positive net migration.<br>
          <br>
          Since then, net migration levels <span style="color: #4287f5; font-weight: bold;">returned</span> to their usual figures.

      <p>
        The population pyramid below shows the amount of overseas migrant arrivals based on age groups, sex, and year periods.<br>
        Out of all periods, most of those groups increrased in numbers and <strong>peaked</strong> in the year period 2022-2023. <br>
        Afterwards, their figures moderately <strong>decreased</strong> in the period 2023-2024.

        <p>
          For all year periods, most of the male overseas migrants were aged between <strong>20 and 29</strong>. But as the age group gets older, there were less occurrences of male overseas migrant arrivals.

          The similar trend applied to female overseas migrants as well, although they had slightly <strong>lower</strong> amounts compared to that of males most of the time.

          The area chart on the right illustrates the amount of overseas migrant arrivals by visa and citizenship status. <br>
          <br>
          Arrivals <strong>increased</strong> in number and peaked in the 2022-2023 period for all types of visa groups, before <strong>decreasing</strong> steadily in the 2023-2024 period.
          Most of the migrant arrivals appeared to hold <strong>temporary visas</strong>.
